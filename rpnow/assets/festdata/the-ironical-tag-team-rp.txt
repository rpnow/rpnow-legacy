The day was about to end peacefully until...\nOne of the children started punching the other. \nJohn got up and saw to it. \"What going on here???\" \nOne of the kids yelled. \"He took it-!! HE TOOK MY DRAWING-!!\" \nJohn looked at the other child. \"Is this true?\"\nThe child nodded, giving John the drawing. \"He drew something God wouldn't like so I took it to throw away-!\" The child piped up.\nJohn looked at the drawing. it was of the devil. Smiling. Killing a girl. \nJohn was outraged. \"What is this...?!?!\" \nThe child who had drawn it replied angrily. \"My sister getting what she deserves! She's a bully! She always tells me God isn't real, and always playing her loud devil music, and drawing satan and worships the Devil! She's ruining our family!!\" He was at the point of crying.\nJohn screwed up the drawing. \"...Are you still faithful to God, child?\" He asked the child, in a serious tone. \nThe child nodded, crying. The other one crossed his arms. \n\"...Good. Now I'm gong to be right back. In the mean time. No more nasty drawings like these, and no fighting. Understood?\" He spoke to all of them. \nThe children all nodded. \"Yes father John.\" \nJohn went out of the room, and into his office. He searched up the childs family name, and searched for his sister.","Time_Created":"1448939247","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#c1d376","#9e5c78","#81f1e6"],"Type":"Character","Chara_Number":"32616","Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"1421114","Content":"(ooooh she in trooooubllllle)","Time_Created":"1448939318","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#2c1938","#342b78","#392497"],"Type":"Character","Chara_Number":"32623","Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"1421120","Content":"(Some lil girl gon die tonight)","Time_Created":"1448939340","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#c1d376","#9e5c78","#81f1e6"],"Type":"Character","Chara_Number":"32616","Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"1421124","Content":"(well actually the night after this since they're going out for dinner :''))","Time_Created":"1448939356","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#c1d376","#9e5c78","#81f1e6"],"Type":"Character","Chara_Number":"32616","Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"1421152","Content":"daddy's gonne turn off the wifi soonish","Time_Created":"1448939445","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#2c1938","#342b78","#392497"],"Type":"Character","Chara_Number":"32623","Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"1421160","Content":"damn. kkkk. :''')))))))","Time_Created":"1448939465","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#c1d376","#9e5c78","#81f1e6"],"Type":"Character","Chara_Number":"32616","Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"1421205","Content":"Lilly flattened her palms on the desk, staring at her trembling fingers.
