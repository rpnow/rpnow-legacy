{"msgs":[{"Number":"3309904","Content":"The way this night began was a cacophony of noise. As soon as Aisu had come back from his daily grind, Tatsu wasted no time in making his desires known even before the pianist could set down his keys. Expletives about how there was this new demo out on the market for a horror game, and how no one has been able to outright solve its mysteries. Tatsu was always a prideful man, always wanting to be the first, to finish first, to always remain as alpha, but the allure of being _the_ man to reach the end of the game wasn\u2019t his goal this time; no, it was to stare into the abyss and have it cower back at him, to look at the horror and _laugh_ at its face. And of course, he wanted to do that with his boyfriend by his side, for what fun was it to brave new terrors without someone along with you for the ride?\n\nHe expected the flat out denial, yes, as he did expect the age-old question of \u201cHow did you even come across this to begin with?\u201d. Tatsu shirked off the question, the muscular artist shrugging it off to be that he had finished a commission and needed a break anyways. So he hopped onto his messenger, strike up a conversation with some chums, and before he had known it the internet craze came up on conversation and piqued the artist\u2019s attention. Aisu was used to this, it had become a cog in the machine of their shared lives; his boyfriend was a dog, a literal animal that once he honed in on something, there was _no_ stopping his wagging tail of excitement nor his trained focus until he got what he wanted. Couple that with his barely-there thinking and you\u2019d be coming home to a mess every single day, be it good or bad. To others it\u2019d prove tiring, but for Aisu it was a godsend; his spirit longed to ache for love rather than for sorrow, and if anything were to strain the ivory pianist, he was grateful that it was his brute of a paramour.","Time_Created":"1459203390","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#67a2dd","#1ff671","#c13692"],"Type":"Narrator","Chara_Number":null,"Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"3309908","Content":"So, with seeing how sheepish the man with obsidian mane gotten, seeing how Tatsu flicked a grin filled to the brim with teeth as sharp as his spirit and his body move naturally in tune to his child-like excitement, Aisu had given in and nodded to the other\u2019s plea, a cat-like notion. And it was then and there that the night had fallen into place for the duo; Tatsu busted out the game system and cursed at its need to update while Aisu placed an order for Chinese take-out (because if the two were going to be nerds for the evening, might as well go all out!). The keys that were dropped were swiftly picked back up as they both packed into their car and drove out once Tatsu had gotten the machine to run, the artist animated and talking about his day while the pianist listened as he drove, silently favoring the husk of Tatsu\u2019s baritone over the radio\u2019s offerings. They returned home, and Tatsu had set the download for the supposedly accursed demo and shoved off to grab whatever pillows he could find while Aisu prepared dinner for the two of them, making sure that Tatsu\u2019s plate had just the right amount of ribs and that his own has just enough shrimp, a flawless stab at perfection.\n\nOnce the couch was filled with fluff, the two dined before they\u2019d set into their adventure, but of course Tatsu was eager, was excited, was _determined_ to start. So while Aisu was distracted he picked up the controller and began their adventure, pulling an unsatisfied grunt from the pianist. Tatsu waved him off and told him to keep eating; he\u2019d blitz them through the starting levels and when Aisu was done he\u2019d get his turn. With a sigh, the man with ivory hair kept eating as he watched on, and it was then that their night had truly began, where it had melted into the couple being absorbed into the game as well as each other, muscles relaxed and tenseness ebbing away\n\nuntil they got really _into_ the game, of course.","Time_Created":"1459203400","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#67a2dd","#1ff671","#c13692"],"Type":"Narrator","Chara_Number":null,"Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"3315021","Content":"_\u201dThe six year old had the good sense of hiding in the bathroom, but her father lured her out by telling her it was just a game\u2026\u201d_ The radio echoed as a thumb idly glossed over the analog stick in out of place patience.\n\n\u201cWells, six year old got \u2018er shit WRECKED.\u201d Tatsu spat out, arms resting on slender and strong legs. After the brute had spent an awful amount of time walking around, the couple had adjusted positions so that they\u2019d be comfortable to play. Aisu sat on the couch whereas Tatsu sat on the floor right in front of the furniture, his boyfriend\u2019s legs propped on either side of the artistic brute.

As soon as the feline of a man sat down, the wolf of a man brought his arms around and pressed Aisu close to his body. The ivory man's backside could feel Tatsu's toned muscles through both of their fabrics, but above all the two could feel their shared heat radiate between them, pure benevolent magma that would never cease to chill between them. The behemoth brought his head down into Aisu's neck and nuzzled into the creak of it, lowly purring and losing himself in his boyfriend's warmth. The affectionate wave soon dripped on as Tatsu adjusted himself to being comfortable; hands landing in Aisu's lap, controller still poised, and his mouth landing right next to Aisu's right ear. Another prod of a light nuzzle before ebony eyes flickered back onto the screen.\n\n\"A'ight, so where were we's...\" The booming baritone was low in volume, almost gentle as to now blow out the pianist's hearing as Tatsu proceeded with the game. A gruff huff of breath affirmed that the draconic boyfriend had noticed the lack of a menu or title screen; apparently the demo played beyond death. An interesting turn, but nothing Tatsu couldn't handle. He exited the main room and began his walk again, this time making sure to heed his lover's advice and only gently nudge the analog stick rather than push full throttle; it made the ride significantly slower, easier to pull pieces from the dark, ambient puzzle.\n\n\"Lemme knows if youse sees anythin' babe.\"","Time_Created":"1459376782","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#67a2dd","#1ff671","#c13692"],"Type":"Character","Chara_Number":"59609","Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"3337875","Content":"He didn\u2019t resist the inevitable embrace, in fact he contributed to it, a soft sigh escaping from him that only further encouraged his body to melt into the other. A pale hand found its way over to the ink-like strokes of coal mane that gently draped over his shoulders, running his fingers through in a way that neither tangled nor pulled. Aisu welcomed the pulses of heartbeats that originated from Tatsu, surrounding him in natural ease with not a single discomforting vibe in sight. Joining the symphony as he felt his own life force resonate in a steady tempo that never did clash with the gangster, despite the unlikely combination of piano notes and drum beats.\n\n\u201cSure thing\u201d Aisu continued to play with Tatsu\u2019s hair as crimson eyes drifted back to the screen to see that he started to once again progress onward, finding it pleasing that he was taking his advice to heart.

Tatsu guided the protagonist down the hall as slowly as he could, but it didn't seem like he was doing it in lieu of the pianist's words. Slowly, delicately, Tatsu tilted his head so that his lips pressed onto Aisu's bare skin, a magma filled kiss so deeply embedded into the ivory's pulse. Closed eyes became half-lidded as the gangster looked back up to the screen to see he was nearing the destination requested. Playing with his prey some more, the behemoth parted his mouth and dragged canines across skin, a teasing notion only the dragon could concoct as he met with Aisu's ear again.
