Nails had stopped by his second one. He knew that these Devil's stomach would fuck up your stomach, and make it letting out some intense noises. The three others however just kept on drinking. Done with the first case, they rapidly began drinking from the next, laughing like hyenas as they did. Nocturlos spotted that Nails wasn't drinking anymore. He grabbed the case and shoved it close to his face \"Here. Grab a beer pal. You are in the band now. Celebrate with us, Fuck everything else, this is what's important.\" Not long after, the second case was empty as well. Shane then called for their manager to order a taxi. Back at the hotel, Bloodlord and Shane were fast to get to bed. Nocturlos was busy fixing up a place to sleep for Nails. Afterwards, he Joined Shane And bloodlord in thei ginormous bed. \"Well guys, we did it. We found a fitting secondary guitarist.\" \"He looks a bit odd though.\" Shane replied. \"He doesn't have that Metal look like the rest of us... But for sure, He is one helluva guitar player. And finally, I can do solos again!\" Bloodlord then came up with an idea: \"We can't go easy on him. Remeber, he must not get the illusion that he is now walking on a red carpet. Remember Jason Newsted from Metallica? The other members were fucking around with him for years, pulling pranks on him, mistreating him and such. Let's have some fun with our new guitarist, shall we?\" The two others agreed. \"Tomorrow, the fun begins\" Nocturlos ended the conversation laughing. \"Goodnight you two.\" They didn't get to sleep just yet though. Suddenly, Bloodlord's stomach began to gurgle. Then. Shane's, followed by Nocturlos'. Judging by how much they drank, the duration of the gurgling would last until next morning. They didn't close their eyes that night. Call it Karma if you like, but Nails is up for some trolling anyway",
