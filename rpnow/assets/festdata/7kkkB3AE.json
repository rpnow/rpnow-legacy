They got no clade or quads looking out for them, no lusus feeding them 'else they'd be here too, a place so dangerous as this, with us big purple motherfuckers about.\" To you, they're easy prey. the kind of motherfuckers you'd pick out for wrigglers as targets on their first raid, pretty colors but no real tooth to cause harm, and no one coming after them for revenge. You don't say that to your new hatefriend though, on account of you think he'd object. \"Trolls ain't motherfuckinf meant for that kinda lonliness, they'll be wanting at shit as they don't got words for, closeness and family, only 'stead've that, here you come all talking at them on how they oughtn't be stealing from motherfuckers and fighting at motherfuckers, when all that's gonna do is see them culled. 'Course they don't listen.\" you pause, curious if he's got aught to say at you yet.",

Your message had been spreading slowly at first, mainly just contained to the lowbloods of your town, but as they get older and start to spread so does your teachings. The crowds you gather get a little bit bigger, and you hear that there are some of your original followers, who've had to move town due to jobs or quadrantmates talking in other places and continuing to teach what you've taught them. The listeners used to not get any higher than yellow, but as time passes you notice more green blooded trolls in the mix, and even a couple of curious teals every now and then. \n\nCinamn's growth had been fast only to stop almost completely after maybe two sweeps. He's no bigger than a rather large barkbeast, and it had worried you quite a bit for a while. You took him to as many dragon specialists as you could find, but none of them could pinpoint anything wrong with him. Cinamn insisted that he felt perfectly fine too, and as time continued to pass with no ill effects you'd come to just accept it. You don't mind his small size at all, if only wishing he was perhaps a little bit /smaller/ whenever he would decide to crawl into your lap. \n\nIt's almost morning when you finally get back to your hive after a long day of preaching. You're about to start getting ready to get into your coon when Cinamn's head shoots up from where he was lying in the corner, and you can instantly feel the worry coming off of him. Before you can ask what's wrong he tells you. /Something bad happened. Sagaru and Kurloz are here,/ he says. You run back downstairs before he can even finish his sentence, and when you head outside Sagaru is landing and you can see Kurloz draped over his neck and covered in /purple./ You know he was standing guard at an auspicism ceremony, he'd been complaining about having to do it to you earlier. You run over and start helping him down off of his dragon and only then do you notice that he's crying. \"Shoosh, shoosh it's okay. What happened?\"",

There are families that choose to fight, and purple blood graces your clubs once more.

She dismisses him before he can go on about some inane thing with being disrespected by filthy landdwellers, as if he's actually respected among seadwellers to begin with. She goes slowly to the shore, in no rush. Her hydra follows behind her, and as she gets on land she sees the Grand Highblood with his painted up face and barbaric charms and beads strung through a huge mess of hair, his small by seadweller standards but large by land ones dragon behind him. At his side is a minuscule little troll, no paint and bright red eyes with a dragon so strange and small at his feet she had mistaken it for a featherbeast for a moment. They're both silent for a moment, and she quickly grows bored of the staring contest. \"Well?

When a large leviathan appeared she knew that must be them, and went quickly to move the prisoner. The shocked and broken expression on the mutant's face when he saw her was certainly one she'd remember, and she quickly had a few of her guards take him away. Trolls of breath are few and far between among seadwellers, practically nonexistent, but she'd managed to find one who could create a nice waterproof chamber for him in her palace and allow for his transport without the risk of drowning the bastard.   \n\nWith that taken care of she focused on the dragon growling at her from under his chains. It's difficult, draining magic, and not something she'd be able to do without the help she has from the horror terrors, but she manages to mask all of that and grin when the Highblood finally comes out of the water and sees her handiwork. The beast is struggling to breath where she holds it's head in her hands, and she makes sure the chains stay on him as she has a few guards /slowly/ take him to the water. He won't die, but his suffering is certainly prolonged. The highblood looks lost and confused and she's sure that will only increase when he leaves and see that whatever force he'd brought along with him decimated. She had instructed her army not to kill them /all,/ just enough to leave a very clear message. Don't fuck with the Condescension.",

She flinches when you touch her, though, and it gives you enough strength to kick, to want to live enough to help your sister live, and she breaks the surface coughing and crying. \n\nYou lose Orrist and his dragon both. Your rogue, who's name you remember is Jashia, loses her Seltan, the little courier dragon. Your reserve was clever enough to hold back out of reach for the most part. You lose two trolls and most of a dragon, and Nujall will never fly again, even if she /wanted/ to after her troll was torn from her mid-dive. \n\nYou limp home, bleeding and broken and mourning, and when Lienne, waiting where she is on the shore, asks, \"What now?\" fire in her eyes and determination in her soul, you say, \"Nothing.\" real motherfucking quiet, and walk past her.",

Maybe, maybe /next time./ \n\nAny thought of next time gets thrown out of your head when you little air bubble one of the seadwellers has managed to make for you gets taken down to an absolutely magnificent building deep below the ocean's surface.

There's some sort of magic holding it together, and when you try to reach out into the water you can't. Even if you could get out, you don't know what you would do.
