She would’ve stopped at nothing in order to obtain the peace she had longed for, for peace she had dreamed of ever since she was brought into existence. When that ivory feline had come into her life, she didn’t bear a second thought of it being anything but real when she had uttered her heart’s deepest desire.\n\nWho could blame her, really? Who could blame such a young girl for wanting to avoid the hurt and heartbreak of people, of reality, of _life?_ Like a princess in mindset caught in the haphazard of fire, she carelessly strung words out from her tender heart, and like as though the gods above decided to bless her like an angel, Kyubey heard her plea and granted her the gift of her inner strength and of her desire in exchange for her soul.\n\nAnd for the time, it was like a dream; she was filled with power her wild imagination wasn’t able to comprehend. She was able to forego her old life and was able to start over anew, able to live and thrive off of herself and herself alone. She was a bird in the winds, free to breathe and never worry of chains suffocating her. It was pure euphoria, pure sanctuary that she had found. But with every fairy tale would come endings, and once again would the bird find themselves locked within the scent of rusted steel.\n\nOnce again, would the princess feel flames lick at her skin.","Time_Created":"1459219246","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#67a2dd","#1ff671","#c13692"],"Type":"Narrator","Chara_Number":null,"Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"3314403","Content":"She leaned on the railings that still stood strong despite being abandoned by man for the past couple of years. Viridian hair was caressed by the winds as her fingers tightened and loosened in anxiety as her emerald vision casted out onto the city. The sun was harsh in its fight setting downwards, casting a blanket of orange to eclipse the city entire with its beauty. But no, Euphie wasn’t able to enjoy being bathed in the afterglow of the day. Her skin practically vibrated, goosebumps littering her skin as her chest tightened and loosened as did her grip in mirror motion.\n\nToday wasn’t a day to be enjoyed, nor to laugh, nor to bathe in life’s little gifts. No, that sense of her heart beating in her chest was ripped from her the moment she had returned to her apartment, from the millisecond she had found those holes barren in the fibers of her life.","Time_Created":"1459219283","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#67a2dd","#1ff671","#c13692"],"Type":"Character","Chara_Number":"59646","Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"3314404","Content":"Shoulders that once held the world with ease now felt the burden of the earth crumbling, rocks toppling down her backside like acid rain. The sixteen year old quaked both inwardly and outwardly as she felt each second slip by, each slip wasted, each waste rotting along like as though it had no business to be here. But if she could, she would snatch back all those hollowed minutes and push back the clock, rewind time so that she could breathe without frigidness in her breath and ice spiking her blood.\n\n“Where is she? It doesn’t take this _long_ to get here!!”\nEuphie’s hands felt like strangers on her skin as she pulled back her sleeve to glance down at her watch. It flickered on as she threw her attention onto it, and the lime digital interface practically screamed back with how it lit up; it was 5:35 PM. The schoolgirl bit down on her lip as she scanned the city once more, clawing at the defense mechanism as though it’d be able to help her titanic wave of anxiety diminish.\n \nSurely her comrade would make it, right? Euphie would wait all day, all _night_ if she had to. Momoko was reliable, she wouldn’t just ditch Euphie in a time of crisis. The viridian girl hugged herself, hands tensing on her arms as she looked down high above the abandoned building.","Time_Created":"1459219291","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#67a2dd","#1ff671","#c13692"],"Type":"Character","Chara_Number":"59646","Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"3318790","Content":"Her name was Momoko.","Time_Created":"1459241711","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#bb60b6","#1b1162","#1f5a1f"],"Type":"Narrator","Chara_Number":null,"Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"3321349","Content":"She was a magical girl, with devastating power with which she would use to protect not just the city, not just the people she cared for, but the whole world if she had to. To have the power to protect, no, to __be__ powerful was what she had always dreamed of. Ever since she first lay eyes on the explosive kaiju of her youth, she had looked up to them for their strength, their power. But she didn't just want to wield the power to destroy, she wanted to create something too at the same time. \n\nShe wanted to create the world’s greatest kaiju, to reinvigorate the genre she loved the most, to bring it into the 21st century and ignite a spark that would be felt across the nation. So when that creature, small in size yet grandiose in power, appeared before her with the opportunity to make that dream a reality, she thought it only natural to snatch up the opportunity; Only natural to find a way to finally make her childhood fantasies a reality.\n\nSo that 'angel' known as Kyubey granted her wish and imbued her soul with such an explosive, burning power, the likes of which had never been seen before. Not only did she gain powers that she never thought possible, but her mind suddenly burned with a creative passion and dexterity that she has been so desperately searching for. Now she could protect, destroy and create; just like she had always wanted. And so she continued to charge through life without a care, because really, it didn't seem like anything could go wrong. Her own contract seemed safe and despite her new duties as a protector of the people, life continued on as it always had.\n \nHer father was proud and happy to have such a creative, strong girl as his daughter. Her classmates continued to rally behind her strength, the bonds of friendship fueling her burning passion. And with each passing day, she grew stronger than ever; not only was she now well renowned for her kaiju designs, but for her skills at fighting too.\n\n/She/ was happy. /She/ was the lucky one.","Time_Created":"1459274297","Time_Updated":null,"IPColor":["#bb60b6","#1b1162","#1f5a1f"],"Type":"Narrator","Chara_Number":null,"Deleted":"0"},{"Number":"3321532","Content":"It wasn't easy to convince her dad to let her leave in the middle of dinner; he was a kindly man but he wasn't a pushover. She hated to disappoint him, but after explaining that a friend might be in trouble, he seemed to understand. Still, she scarfed down her peppered steak before leaving to give her the fuel her body so desperately needed. If she was going to make it in time, for what she didn't really know, she would need all the energy she could get.\n\nSo now there she was, thundering through the streets of the city, bathed in blazing hue which matched her long fiery locks. In retrospect, it hadn't really been that long since she had first met Euphie, a girl who seemed to be, in many respects, completely different to her. Euphie tended to like things quite neat and tidy, while she was a rough and tumble sort of girl; someone who wasn't afraid to get stuck in.

She could sense that her partner stood at the top, waiting desperately for her to arrive. Soon the emerald girl would probably be able to hear her pounding footsteps as she edged closer and closer to her.\n\nDespite their differences, they were a team, and a damn good one at that. Like Godzilla and Mothra, the two of them might have been completely different to one another, they both possessed a strength that could be used for the greater good, and by teaming up they could work miracles. Plus, Momoko had become so fond of her; she was a bit of a fusspot at times, but she was fun to be around and exceptionally supportive.\n\nThat's why as soon as the thundering kaiju magical girl had heard that her comrade was in some sort of trouble, she had to get there as soon as possible. As she burst through the door to the roof, she swiveled her head around, looking for her viridescent friend, until her blazing glare fell onto her and softened.

With the macabre thought, she looked over the railings, looked down upon the people that were going about their daily lives.\n\nWhen she heard the creak of the door behind her bust ajar, the viridian puella magi spun around and saw the orange blur of her friend as Momoko’s words met with Euphie’s concentration. What was of precise and perfect computer was now nothing more than an overheated, sputtering husk of machine; Euphie was bordering broken, if she had not reached that point already.\n\n“Mo..” Her voice stalled before she swallowed and tried again. “Momoko-!!” The expression on the girl’s face instanatenously melted, the ice that pricked her blood now dissolving into pools of radiating energy that reflected upon her vision as she ran herself over to the girl made of sardonyx and magma. “Thank goodness, it’s fine, don’t worry!”\n\nEuphie’s voice was her anxiety personified, squeaks and cracks galore.

Now she was struggling to keep face even for a second. It was tough for even her, with all of her might, to watch without feeling an aching within her blazing heart. As she told of her misfortune, she mulled over her words for a moment, slowly deciding upon the best words to use, as she always did.\n\nBut the words were harder to find than usual. It felt like a millennium before she finally staggered upon the right words to say. \n\n\"I'm... so sorry.\"\n\nHer voice was as low as it always was, but it's power and energy was far more reserved than usual. Although she never knew much about Chrome, she knew that they meant more than anything in the world to the verdant magical girl.

Did you mean that? I don’t know what you meant. I-“ With a tremble of her body, Euphie sucked in air and rolled her shoulders to try and echo out the oceans crashing in her mind and creating white noise. With a hard blink she focused back on the molten magical girl, but again, the tidal waves would surface and lick at Euphie’s features.\n\n“I-I’m sorry. His stuff, his everything, everything just _vanished.”_ Reflexively her hands came up to hold herself, her nails beginning to dig at her long sleeved top. “W-We had an argument the other day.
