However, the glistening stars shined as bright as they ever could, showing nothing past their glows only vast darkness. It all seemed so close, yet so far. No matter how high she flew, the could never be touched, making her feel trapped and alone. \n\nWith a leather cloak covering her thin frame, a woman looking no younger than twenty strolled along the stone brick walkway away from the village she was leaving behind. She had not seen the world around her in forever, the way these stones felt. The way the trees, and grass and mobs in the distance … it almost felt like she was looking upon a newly generated world. With that sense, it was all still so familiar to her. The thoughts of anger, sadness and terror cried in her head. She raised her hands to her ears as if to block it out but it only got worse.\n\nThen it fell quiet, quieter than it had ever been before. A tall grey structure stood out in the distance, the moon slowly rising behind it made it quite easy to see. Her shoulders drooped, and she continued walking. /Was it even worth seeing now? Another place where i’d just feel like breaking down?/ She clasped her shaking hands in fists and stared down at the stones below her till she felt like she would burn holes in them. She turned her back away from the structure and took a deep breath…..\n\n\n…. And took flight.\n\n/Am I really doing this? .../ A lone thought crossed her mind, followed by several others. /Am I just going to leave it all behind? Just like that?/ Doubt. That’s all that was talking to her. She shook it from her head and continued onwards, soaring high over the lit village and past the trees and plains beyond.\n\n/Good bye, Alice. Good bye, Marisa. Good … bye, Apollo. Good bye, Lucus … Coal …. James … Midnight. I will miss you. But I am doing this for my own good. I expect Lucus will take good care of you three..

If he somehow followed her, somehow, even after all this time, that would be fine too. That was his sworn duty after all.\n\n…\n\nDay broke over a nearby mountain, shattering golden beams all over the valley below. The tiredness in the red haired dragoness shown definitely in dark bags under her eyes. She was used to not sleeping for long periods of time like this, but she finally had the chance to rest all she liked. However, it wasn’t sleep that stopped her. Something deep within made her heart race.\n\n/I could finally .../ \nShe took a deep breath … and dive bombed down to the base of the mountain. From there she fluttered down loudly onto the soft green grasses and stared down at the ground. /Its somewhere, down there … I can feel it…./ She slowly closed her eyes and listened.\n\nWhen she opened them again, they blazed a bright magenta. Her path became clear. Several layers of rock below her feet, she could sense it … feel it …. \n\nWith tools she had managed to acquired from some of the villagers in a nearby village, she started her job with a bright iron shovel, then a shimmering picaxe as soon as she reached the hard stone.
