RPNow was created in March 2015 by me, [Nigel Nelson](http://nigelnelson.me).
I single-handedly designed and coded the site's initial incarnation, and am
still responsible for nearly all of the code in the project.

The idea was originally inspired by __Hannah Liddell__, who now assists with
making design decisions, as well as interacting with and gathering feedback
from the users of the site.


Technologies Used
-----------------
RPNow can easily be installed on a [LAMP stack
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29), simply by
dropping in and modifying some files into the public www directory. However,
the live version hosted on [LEMP stack](https://lemp.io/) with [MariaDB
(https://mariadb.org/) instead. The front-end uses HTML5, CSS, and
JavaScript, meaning no browser plugins are required for clients to use it.

The following libraries have simplified development:
* [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com) version 2, with the
  [Slim-Basic-Auth](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/slim-basic-auth)
  add-on for the admin panel.
* [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org) as the template engine.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to simplify javascript in some places.
* [Spectrum](https://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/) as the color-picker for
  browsers without one built-in.
* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) to handle times, timezones, and dates.

Additional technologies used to develop RPNow:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good,
  light-weight text editor that has suited my needs very well.
* [XAMPP Server](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is a good
  webserver bundle for Windows.
* [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com) hosts some javascript and CSS libraries
  off-site.
* [Github](https://github.com) and [GitHub Desktop]
  (https://desktop.github.com/) have made version control for RPNow painless.
